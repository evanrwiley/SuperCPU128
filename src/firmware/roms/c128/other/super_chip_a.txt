This is a ROM dump of an EPROM I found socketed in the "empty" socket of my 
C128. The label on the EPROM says: 

	Super Chip
	Chip "A"
	2.0

I don't have any original documentation on it. 

It adds the following features to the function keys in C128 mode:

F1 = Nibbler
F2 = GO64:LOAD":*",8,1
F3 = File Copier
F4 = Seq file reader
F5 = Terminal
F6 = Screen Dump

It may do more, but that's all I've figured out.
