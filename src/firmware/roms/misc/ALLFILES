characters/
  c128.bin
  - 390059-01 Commodore 128 character ROM.  The first half has the standard
  - Commodore 64 character set, and the second half has the C128 mode character
  - set, which is slightly different.  All characters except the lower case m
  - are identical with the Commodore 16 character set.  The uppercase/graphics
  - character set is identical with the C64, including the reverse at sign (@)
  - bug, which is missing from the lowercase/uppercase character set.
  c16-hungarian.bin
  - Hungarian Commodore 16 character set made by Novotrade.  The capital A and
  - P, the lower-case i and the graphics characters $65 and $67 in the
  - uppercase/graphics bank and $65 in the lowercase/uppercase bank have gone
  - through cosmetic changes.  The national characters are present in the
  - lowercase/uppercase bank in positions obtained by pressing the C= key with
  - a letter.
  c16-hungarian.readme
  - Keyboard layout for using the Hungarian Commodore 16 character set.  Typed
  - in the ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2) character set; when viewed with ISO 8859-1
  - (Latin-1), the accents look a bit different.
  c16.bin
  - Commodore 16 character set with more beautiful lowercase/uppercase
  - character set than the C64.  The lower case characters b, c, d, e, f, h, i,
  - j, k, l and m have been improved.  The font does not contain reversed
  - characters, therefore only 2 kilobytes.
  c64-german.bin
  - An amateur hacked version of the Commodore 64 character set, with some
  - German special characters.  This was found on a piggybacked EPROM in a
  - German VIC-20 (VC-20).  There are three inconsistencies in the reversed
  - uppercase/graphics character set: The at sign bug/feature, the space char
  - (the ROM tries to define a fancy cursor), and the line-drawing char C=e
  - (code 113; an apparent bug).  In the lowercase/uppercase character set
  - there are inconsistencies in following characters: @, j, m, y, space, Ã¤
  - (code 110; the reversed Ã¤ is corrupted).
  c64-hungarian.bin
  - An amateur hacked version of the Commodore 64 character set, with some
  - Hungarian special characters.  Except for the at sign (in the
  - uppercase/graphics character set at position 0; in the lowercase/uppercase
  - character set at position 100), the reverse character set is consistent.
  c64-swedish.bin
  - Official Commodore 64 Swedish/Finnish character set with the Ã¥, Ã¤ and Ã¶
  - characters.  In addition to the at sign bug/feature, there's a bug in the
  - reversed upper case Ã„ character in both character sets.  This image might
  - be corrupt.  See c64-swedish3.bin.
  c64-swedish2.bin
  - Alternative version of the Commodore 64 Swedish/Finnish character set.
  - Compared to c64-swedish.bin, the Ã„ and Ã– dots and the Ã… ring are wider.
  - This image might be corrupt.  See c64-swedish4.bin.
  c64-swedish3.bin
  - Character rom from Swedish c64, equivalent to c64-swedish.bin
  c64-swedish4.bin
  - Character rom from Swedish c64, equivalent to c64-swedish2.bin
  c64.bin
  - 901225-01 Commodore 64/128 character set.  Every vertical line is at least
  - 2 pixels wide in order to avoid color errors on television.  Also the C=M
  - and C=G graphic characters have been made 2 pixels wide, which is an error.
  - The reverse at sign is not an exact reverse of the character, which can be
  - seen either as a bug (because of the 2 pixels minimum width restriction) or
  - as a feature. 2532 type.
  c65-caff.bin
  - Commodore 65 alternative character set, taken from a C65 ROM with the
  - checksum $CAFF.  This is an exact copy of the Commodore 128 character set.

  characters.901447-azerty.bin
  - Char rom for french AZERTY keyboard, based on 901447-08 and 10.
  kauno.bin
  - A calligraphic font (Finnish: kaunokirjoitus, Swedish: vÃ¤lskrivning) for
  - the Commodore 64.  The data was saved from a tape from 1985.
  keyboard-swedish.txt
  - Swedish/Finnish keyboard layout of the VIC-20, Commodore 64 and Commodore
  - 128.  Composed by Pasi Ojala and Marko MÃ¤kelÃ¤.
  listfont.c
  - C source code for displaying a 8*8 font.
  pet-1.bin
  - 901447-08 PET character generator ROM (BASIC 1).  The character design is
  - the same as in 901447-10, only the lower case and upper case characters
  - have changed places.  Reversed characters are absent.
  pet-2.bin
  - 901447-10 PET character generator ROM.  Used in the Fat 40, 8032SK and
  - 8296.  Doesn't contain reversed characters.  This ROM is just like the VIC-
  - 20 character set, except that the code $1c (in both halves) is backslash
  - (\) instead of the British pound sign (Â£), which was used in the newer
  - character sets.
  pet-greek.bin
  - Greek character generator ROM.  Some Latin characters have been replaced
  - with Greek ones.  This font is not very consistent: for instance, the two
  - copies of the @ sign at code positions $00 and $80, as do the two copies of
  - the capital Phi at $06 and $c6.  This character generator was found on a 4-
  - kilobyte chip, whose first half was identical with the 901447-10 character
  - generator.
  pet-norwegian.bin
  - Norwegian character generator ROM.
  pet-russian.bin
  - 901447-10 PET character generator ROM modified to have Cyrillic letters in
  - the positions $42..$5a.  Contributed (manually reproduced) by Dima Sobolev.
  pet-swedish.bin
  - 901447-14 PET character generator ROM with the characters [\]{|} replaced
  - with Ã…Ã–Ã…Ã¤Ã¶Ã¥.
  superpet-swedish.bin
  - 901640-01 SKAND.GEN (label on EPROM).  SuperPET character generator ROM
  - with the characters [\]{|} replaced with Ã„Ã–Ã…Ã¤Ã¶Ã¥.
  superpet.bin
  - 901640-01 SuperPET character generator ROM.  The first half of this ROM is
  - identical with pet-2.bin, and the second half of this ROM contains a true
  - ASCII character set and an APL character set.
  vic20-german.bin
  - A German character set modelled after the Vic-20 character set.  Used in
  - the German Commodore 128 (top part of the 315079-01 ROM) and in the German
  - 64DX (C65) prototype.
  vic20-japanese.bin
  - A Japanese character set used in the VIC-1001.  The British pound (Â£) has
  - been replaced with a Japanese yen (Â¥) symbol, and the lowercase/uppercase
  - set has been replaced with an uppercase/Kanji set of glyphs.
  vic20-norwegian.bin
  - A Norwegian/Danish character set modelled after the Vic-20 character set.
  - Used in the Norwegian/Danish Commodore 128.  The characters @, !, /, <, >
  - and the up arrow are different, and so are many graphics characters.  The
  - characters [Â£] have been replaced with Ã†Ã˜Ã….
  vic20-swedish.bin
  - A Swedish/Finnish character set based on the Vic-20 character set.  Grabbed
  - from a localized VIC-20.  The reversed lower case Ã¶ is malformed. Chip
  - markings: NEC JAPAN R22101-207 / D2332C 510 UD7. (Yes, it is a mask-
  - programmable 4k*8 ROM!)
  vic20.bin
  - 901460-03 VIC-20 character generator ROM.  Most lines are 1 pixel wide,
  - since there is no possibility of color errors with the Vic's wide pixels.
  - This character generator is also used on many PET computers.
computers/
  * Firmware for Commodore 8-bit home computers. The chronological order is:
  * VIC-20, C64, plus/4, C128, C65.
  computers/b/
    * The Commodore 600 series was known as the B128 in the United States, and
    * the machine that was known there as the B256, was called the 700 series
    * in Europe.  These machines are also known as "CBM II Low Profile" and
    * "CBM II High Profile", respectively.
    * The 600 and the 700 series are almost identical, but 700 series machines
    * have a built-in monitor, a separate keyboard, and a different character
    * generator ROM.  The 610/710 has 128kB RAM, the 620/720 has 256kB RAM, and
    * the 630/730 has 256kB RAM and a co-processor card (Z80 and 8088 were
    * planned, but it is not sure if these cards actually existed).
    * The 500 series uses a 6567/6569 VIC-II video chip instead of the 6845
    * CRTC. It also runs at around 1 MHz instead of the 2 MHz of other Model B
    * computers.
    * Of th roms below, the kernal and BASIC 8k roms are 2364 / MCM68764
    * compatible, while the character roms are .. complicated.  The schematic
    * says they are 4k 2332s, but also that pin 21 (an active-high chip select
    * on the 2332) is A12, which suggests it wants to be an 8k 2364/68764.  I
    * have no idea.

    - The 251913-01, used in newer versions of the Commodore 64 and some
    - versions of the Commodore 128, is a 16-kilobyte 23128 ROM chip.  It
    - contains the Commodore 64 BASIC interpreter ($A000-$BFFF, corresponding
    - to the 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM chip 901226-01) and the Commodore 64 KERNAL
    - ($E000-$FFFF, corresponding to the 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM chip 901227-03) in

    - This one was archived from a 27128 EPROM 27128 EPROM chip in a West
    - German machine DA5 016014E, assy no. 250469, 252311 rev.B. The chip has
    - the label Â© 1984, 90 CBM / 390852-01 / C64GS ROM CS=DF34. The BASIC part
    - corresponds otherwise to 901226-01, but the 30 unused bytes at $BF53-
    - $BF70 are filled with $00 instead of $AA.  The KERNAL part has been
    - modified from the 901227-03, and most modifications are in the area $F72C-
    - $FC92, which also contains a copyright message. Many jumps have been
    - redirected to $FB4D, which in turn jumps to $F707, which in turn triggers
    - I/O error #5.

    - This 8-kilobyte ROM has been reported in various machines (4064, PET64,
    - EDUCATOR64), which are versions of the Commodore 64 built in a PET case
    - with an integrated monochrome monitor.  The system interrupt routine
    - resets sprite, background and border colors to black unless the high-
    - order bit of the location 646 (cursor colour, $0286) is set.  Using any
    - colour command resets location 646 and, therefore, the colors.
    kernal.901227-01.bin
    - This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the first revision of the Commodore 64
    - KERNAL.  The RS-232 timing table is designed for exactly 1 MHz system
    - clock frequency, although no C64 runs at that clock rate.  Unlike later
    - KERNAL revisions, this one does not detect the video system (PAL/NTSC).

    - units.

  * Firmware for Commodore disk drives.
  * According to William Levak, Commodore used six different native disk
  * formats:
  * 2040/3040 - This is slightly different from later formats: tracks 18 - 24
  * have 20 sectors instead of 19.
  * 2031/4040/1540/1541/1551/1570 - single sided, single density, 48tpi
  * 1571 - A double sided version.
  * 8050 - single sided, 96tpi
  * 1001/8250 - double sided, 96tpi
  * 1581, 3Â½" DD with MFM
  * While we're on the subject, Commodore's single density drives are actually
  * double density, and the double density drives are actually quad density.
  * Quad density disks have the same capacity of high density disks, but the
  * magnetic film is compatible with double density disks.
  drives/new/
    * Serial bus based Commodore disk drives
    drives/new/1541/
      * This directory contains ROMs of 1540, 1541, 1541C and 1541-II drives.
      * The ROM checksums are valid.  If you add the byte values together (adc
      * data:adc #0), the sum of the $c000-$dfff ROM will be $c0, and the $e000-
      * $ffff ROM will add up to $e0.  This applies also to the halves of the
      * 1541-II ROM.  The 2764 and 27128 eproms can be used as replacements.
      1540-c000.325302-01.bin
      - The ROM chip for $c000-$dfff.  This seems to be the same on all models
      - before the 1541-II.
      1540-e000.325303-01.bin
      - The firmware of an 1540 (the drive that the C64 wouldn't keep up with).
      - The revision number might be something else than -01.  A speciality of
      - this chip is the power-up message: 73,CBM DOS V2.6 V170,00,00.  Did
      - Commodore want to call the drive V170 first?  The ROM checksum is
      - correct. The long-board 1541 had the same hardware as the 1540; this
      - upper ROM was the only difference.  The lower ROM was 325302-01 on both
      - drives.
      1541-II.251968-03.bin
      - 1541-II firmware.  Released in 1987.

      - service manual says that this ROM is for North America and Japan only.
      - According to it, a 901229-02 also exists, but not in North America.
      - 901229-03 is said to be the first version that is usable in Europe.
      1541-e000.901229-02.bin
      - Second version of the 1541 firmware.  Uploaded by Raymond Day
      - <raymondday@hotmail.com>.  Two delay loops are shorter than in 901229-
      - 03, and the checksum byte at $fee6 has been adjusted accordingly.
      1541-e000.901229-03.bin
      - The firmware of an old-style 1541 with long board. This ROM has an
      - autobooting feature: if CLK and DATA are held low during bootup, the
      - drive will wait for them to raise, and execute a "&*" command.

      - 1541C firmware, was removed in the 1541-II firmware.
      1541C.251968-01.bin
      - The firmware of an old-style 1541 in white case.  This drive was
      - introduced around the same time with the C128 and the 1570, to make it
      - look like the C128 and the 1570, which was also in a white 1541-style
      - case.  The C128 was also white.  This drive has an optical track 1
      - sensor, but it won't be used unless the jumper J3 on the board is cut.
      - The $c000-$dfff part of this chip is identical to the 325302-01 ROM.
      1541C.251968-02.bin
      - An upgrade ROM for the 1541C.  There are patches in both 8k halves.
