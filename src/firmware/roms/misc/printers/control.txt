This document is derived from information composed by William Levak
(wlevak@sdf.org), mostly from the "Pet Personal Computer Guide".
According to him, the control codes seem to be fairly consistent
with the IEEE printers, but the serial printers seem to be quite
different.  The secondary address are consistent with all Commodore
printers.
