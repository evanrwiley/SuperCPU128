The file vc-20-diag.324173-01.bin was read out of a TI 2532 Eprom, the
label to that Eprom says

The Eprom was soldered in, on a PCB with Fab.No 324.171-01. The PCB seems
to be prepared to carry more stuff: 1K of memory is also located on the
cart, but there seems to be an option for 3K and another 4K Eprom. A bunch
of jumpers seems to make 4K/8K/16K cartridges on that PCB.
                                                                                
The cartridge itself is labelled

The cartridge is brown plastic. Of course, there are some diagnostic plugs
in the set, but I won't have the complete set (the IEC port connector is
missing, I only have open wires on that end).
