I've not had a chance to try the carts... perhaps today. I understand
that one type of diag cart requires an "octopus" cable or "harness" that
tests all the ports. Obviously I didn't get such a cable or any docs.

Some info on what I have: The C64 cart has the number V586220 on a
paper sticker after "C64 DIAGNOSTIC" on top. Inside, there is one 2764
socketed EPROM labeled U1, an empty 28 pin socket labeled U2, and a 24 pin
board location without a socket at U3. There are no other components except
a few caps and three "jumpers" (like a disk drive has for device #).

The other cart has no number, just "VIC-20 DIAGNOSTIC" on a paper
sticker glued to the top of a standard game cart type of case. Inside,
there is a socketed 2532 UV-erasable EPROM, no socket at a 24 pin board
location, and six M589581P SRAM chips. Nothing is marked except six of the
eight "jumpers". The board has a few ID numbers and "copyright 1980 CBM".
