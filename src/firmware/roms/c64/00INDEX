** Firmware for all variations on the Commodore 64k computer.
** The eprom type for 8k BASIC & KERNAL is a 2564.  A 2764 can
** be used with an appropriate adapter.  Char roms can be
** replaced with a 2532, or a 2732 with adapter.  The 16k rom
** in the 64C can be replaced with a 27128 eprom.

64c.251913-01.bin
  The 251913-01, used in newer versions of the Commodore 64 and some
  versions of the Commodore 128, is a 16-kilobyte 23128 ROM chip.  It
  contains the Commodore 64 BASIC interpreter ($A000-$BFFF,
  corresponding to the 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM chip 901226-01) and the
  Commodore 64 KERNAL ($E000-$FFFF, corresponding to the 8-kilobyte 2364
  ROM chip 901227-03) in that order.

64gs.390852-01.bin
  The 390852-01, used in the ill-fated Commodore 64GS game console based
  on the BN/E circuit board, is a 16-kilobyte chip similar to the
  251913-01.  This one was archived from a 27128 EPROM 27128 EPROM chip
  in a West German machine DA5 016014E, assy no. 250469, 252311 rev.B.
  The chip has the label © 1984, 90 CBM / 390852-01 / C64GS ROM CS=DF34.
  The BASIC part corresponds otherwise to 901226-01, but the 30 unused
  bytes at $BF53-$BF70 are filled with $00 instead of $AA.  The KERNAL
  part has been modified from the 901227-03, and most modifications are
  in the area $F72C-$FC92, which also contains a copyright message.
  Many jumps have been redirected to $FB4D, which in turn jumps to
  $F707, which in turn triggers I/O error #5.

basic.901226-01.bin
  Commodore 64 BASIC V2.  The first and essentially only revision,
  located at $A000-$BFFF.  In the 64GS system firmware, the 30 unused
  bytes at $BF53-$BF70 are filled with $00 instead of $AA.  In the
  Commodore 65 firmware, these bytes are filled with $FF.

kernal.325017.swedish-02.bin
  Commodore 64 kernal from unit with Swedish keyboard layout.

kernal.4064.901246-01.bin
  This 8-kilobyte ROM has been reported in various machines (4064,
  PET64, EDUCATOR64), which are versions of the Commodore 64 built in a
  PET case with an integrated monochrome monitor.  The system interrupt
  routine resets sprite, background and border colors to black unless
  the high-order bit of the location 646 (cursor colour, $0286) is set.  Using
  any colour command resets location 646 and, therefore, the colors.

kernal.901227-01.bin
  This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the first revision of the Commodore 64
  KERNAL.  The RS-232 timing table is designed for exactly 1 MHz system
  clock frequency, although no C64 runs at that clock rate.  Unlike
  later KERNAL revisions, this one does not detect the video system
  (PAL/NTSC).  This KERNAL was probably only used in early North
  American Commodore 64 units.

kernal.901227-02.bin
  This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the second revision of the Commodore 64 KERNAL.
  It is the second most widely spread version.

kernal.901227-03-DK.bin
  Commodore 64 kernal from unit with Danish keyboard layout.

kernal.901227-03.bin
  This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the third and essentially last revision of the
  Commodore 64 KERNAL.  It is the most widely spread version.

kernal.906145-02.bin
  This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is from a Japanese release Commodore 64.

kernal.c64-scand.bin

pla.c
  This C program contains the logic equations for the 82S100 PLA chip
  used in the C64 (906114-1), and converts them to a 64-kilobyte truth
  table file.  In this second version of the program, the input and output
  lines are permuted so that they correspond to the 82S100-to-27512 adapter
  built by Jens Schönfeld, so that he could read out the PLA with an EPROM
  programming device.

pla.txt
  Logic equations in Abel format for the 82S100 PLA chip used in
  the C64 (906114-1), and a JEDEC file that can used to burn a 82S100
  as a 906114-1.

  The archive also contains a picture of Jens Schönfeld's SuperPLA
