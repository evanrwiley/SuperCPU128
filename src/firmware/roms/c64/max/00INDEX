basic.901230-01.bin
  CBM BASIC V2, taken from the BASIC cartridge for the Commodore MAX,
  also known as VIC-10 or UltiMax.  Unlike the BASIC interpreter in
  the Commodore 64, which resides at $A000-$BFFF, this one is
  located at $8000-$9FFF.  The 2764 EPROM was hand labeled 901230-01.
  The board in the cartridge has three chips: two 2764 EPROMs (U1, BASIC
  and U2, KERNAL) and one HM6116P-4 SRAM (U3).  The bottom side is
  marked FAB 326314, A/W 326315 REV A, and the top side is labelled
  EPROM/EPROM/RAM and ASSY 326312.  See also kernal.901231-01.bin.
  There should also be "MINI BASIC I".
kernal.901231-01.bin
  Commodore MAX KERNAL ROM, taken from the BASIC cartridge for the

  basic.901230-01.bin.
