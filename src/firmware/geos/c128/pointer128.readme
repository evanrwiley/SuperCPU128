This utility replaces the default GEOS128 80-column pointer with another
smaller pointer.  This is not a pointer editor; the alternate pointer is
hardcoded into the program.

Source code is included, so if you have geoProgrammer, you could change the
code to reflect whatever pointer you want; one could also envision expanding
this to a real pointer editor....
